# Multi-Agent Systems and Simulation
 
---

<!-- page_number: true -->




## Objectives of this course (1)

* Activity-based modeling is an important approach to traffic modeling and simulation
* Domain entities (traffic participants and infrastructure) are regarded as agents with local and individual information and motivation states and differing capabilities
	* They select their actions based on some inherent logic
	* They perform their actions in the (simulated) environment
	* Conflicts and cooperation opportunities occur and require negotiation and coordination
	* Agents can communicate with each other
* The multiagent systems research field provides appropriate modeling abstractions and models and mechanisms for coordination
* It can provide a basis for activity-based modeling

## Objectives of this course (2)

* To provide a general motivation of an introduction to the core concepts of intelligent agents and multiagent systems
	* To survey important models and algorithms for automated coordination and cooperation
 	* To provide basics of automated negotiation and collective decision making mechanisms
  	* To keep you from falling asleep by allowing you to - practically explore basic concepts and tools of agent/MAS modeling and simulation
